A library I wrote for my Group Managment v2 application to send and recieve files. Very simple and rudamentary but it works.


Objective:
  Create a class that can initiate a windows notification based off a request through a socket

Functions:

  - Send a message over a socket that is displayed as a windows notification

Notes:

  - This was developed to be used in CCv2

Date: circa. Early 2020

This project was created around 2019-2020 and is sealed.
